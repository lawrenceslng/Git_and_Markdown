# Learning Markdown

Markdown is a pretty useful note taking language. I definitely need to use it more often and keep my skills sharp. [MarkdownGuide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a good place to start on learning the syntax.

# Basic Syntax

## Headings

Hash/Pound/Number sign (#) is used to create Headings. You can have from 1 to 6 of these symbols to create different sized headings.

## Bold

Bolding of text can be done by using asterisks (*). Add 2 asterisks before and after a **word** or **phrase like shown here**. You can also b**ol**d letters inside of a word.

## Italics

Italics can be added with 1 asterisk. Do so like *such* or in *a phrase like such*. You can also italicize le*tt*ers inside of a word.

## Bold AND Italics

To bold AND italicize a word, use 3 asterisks. Like ***shown here***. Also can be done wi***th***in a word.

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes is used to define "a section that is quoted from another source", and they can be done with (>) symbol

>This will look like this
>
>And it can span for multiple lines
>
>>You can also nest blockquotes
>>>Wonder how many times

## Unordered Lists

Simple to implement with (-)

- list
- as 
- you
    - go

## Ordered Lists

Using numbers

1. List
2. As
3. You
    1. Go

## Code Blocks

I like using the (```) method

```
put your code in between ```
```

## Images

Type ! then [] followed by link of image in ()
